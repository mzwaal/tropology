# Tropology 

Tropology crawls TVTropes.org, converts the relationships between pages into a PostgreSQL database, and helps you visualize relationships between concepts, tropes, creators and material.

This is currently a personal experiment.  Consider it raw, pre-alpha code and likely to change.

This is version 0.4.0.

[You can read more on our site](http://numergent.com/tags/tropology/).


## Prerequisites

### Clojure

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

### PostgreSQL

My current development environment is PostgreSQL 9.4.1. It expects a database called _tropology_ for the dev environment, and _tropology_test_ for the test environment.

There are migration scripts included, but they act only upon the tables and do not create the databases.

See <pre>scripts/create-test-environment.sh</pre> for how I'm creating a Docker container on OS X for tests.

After you have installed PostgreSQL and created the databases, you'll need to run:

    ENV=test lein clj-sql-up migrate
    lein clj-sql-up migrate

### Sample database

[Here you can find a pg_dump'd copy of the fully scanned site](https://mega.co.nz/#!EhZxhBhK!lT38KiMhGxTbjGKD6tJuimc48Tay4ILkEt70evgeM7c). It's 3.22GBs, and includes the entire CC-licensed pages for those matching our crawl settings.

Import into Postgres using psql as usual.

I'm no longer publishing a database version without the contents, since the current visualization and exploration rely on the HTML to extract the reference descriptions.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein cljsbuild once
    lein ring server

Then go to http://localhost:3000/ and enter "Anime/SamuraiFlamenco" on the text box and press *Graph!*.

## A note on Cursive Clojure

Cursive Clojure does not yet support a way to launch a REPL with specific environment profile. Since the application reads its database connection parameters from the environment configuration, if you start a REPL form Cursive and run the tests against it, you'll be running them against the development database and not the test one.

Make sure you either create a REPL profile specifically for the test settings, or just run the tests via *lein*.

## Using 

You currently have two exploration options, *Graph* and *Trope text*.

### Graph

The graph view displays a (currently somewhat messy) graph of all nodes and related connections.  Clicking any particular node will highlight only that node and its correlated concepts (concepts that both link to the central one and each other).   Double-clicking a node will make a graph out of that node neighborhood.

You can also see the raw data by going to: http://localhost:3000/api/network/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco

### Trope text

I'm finding the trope text exploration more interesting. When you enter an article code, it'll display the article's title and summary, along with a random trope mention from the list included on that article. You can choose to mark the snippet as interesting, which adds it to a list of tropes clicked, or skip it.

You will need the full database in order to do text exploration.

**BEWARE: THAR BE SPOILERS**!  I am not yet applying any style that would hide topic spoilers.

If you find a trope mentioned interesting, you can also click on the trope link.  This will load it as the next article being reviewed, as well as add the text snippet to the list of articles you've liked.

None of this information is currently saved, since I'm only playing with the trope exploration, but that's on my to do list.


## Next steps

I'm liking the text trope exploration, and will be blending it with the graph display (which by itself doesn't contain that much information).  Next steps are:

* Show a graph of the pieces the user has liked, the articles referenced on them, and which articles those have in common.
* Save a set of references we've found interesting during the exploration stage.
* Pursue occasional _unexpected DOM mutation_ or _invariant violation_ issues from React. I suspect it happens on cases where we get an error displaying some of the scraped HTML.
* We're currently showing as possible snippets all *twikilink* elements, but some summary articles use that only to link to other sub-sections and don't contain any actual information.  See about filtering them out.
