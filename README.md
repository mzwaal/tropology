# Tropology 

Tropology crawls TVTropes.org, converts the relationships between pages into a PostgreSQL database, and helps you visualize relationships between concepts, tropes, creators and material.

This is currently a personal experiment.  Consider it raw, pre-alpha code and likely to change.

Current version is 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.

## Prerequisites

### Clojure

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

### PostgreSQL

My current development environment is PostgreSQL 9.4.1. It expects a database called _tropology_ for the dev environment, and _tropology_test_ for the test environment.

There are migration scripts included, but they act only upon the tables and do not create the databases.

See <pre>scripts/create-test-environment.sh</pre> for how I'm creating a Docker container on OS X for tests.

After you have installed PostgreSQL and created the databases, you'll need to run:

    ENV=test lein clj-sql-up migrate
    lein clj-sql-up migrate

### Sample databases

You have two pg_dump'd options if you wish to use a pre-loaded data set for your dev database.

* [Only pages and links](https://mega.co.nz/#!B55wARCQ!H_4sx3jJIUU3Jx2jn5uQdfXcGEe7skCK9STofern7Xk) (116MBs)
* [Full crawled contents](https://mega.co.nz/#!80RyWaiC!N6s2PH7QgwscozsDwv2h8108qlu7wp0Pq2hu6tNj-pc) (3.04GBs)

Import into Postgres using psql as usual.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein cljsbuild once
    lein ring server

Then go to http://localhost:3000/ and enter "Anime/SamuraiFlamenco" on the text box and press *Graph!*.

## A note on Cursive Clojure

Cursive Clojure does not yet support a way to launch a REPL with specific environment profile. Since the application reads its database connection parameters from the environment configuration, if you start a REPL form Cursive and run the tests against it, you'll be running them against the development database and not the test one.

Make sure you either create a REPL profile specifically for the test settings, or just run the tests via *lein*.

## Using 

You currently have two exploration options, *Graph* and *Trope text*.

### Graph

The graph view displays a (currently somewhat messy) graph of all nodes and related connections.  Clicking any particular node will highlight only that node and its correlated concepts (concepts that both link to the central one and each other).   Double-clicking a node will make a graph out of that node neighborhood.

You can also see the raw data by going to: http://localhost:3000/api/network/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco

### Trope text

I'm finding the trope text exploration more interesting. When you enter an article code, it'll display the article's title and summary, along with a random trope mention from the list included on that article. You can choose to mark the snippet as interesting, which adds it to a list of tropes clicked, or skip it.

You will need the full database in order to do text exploration.

**BEWARE: THAR BE SPOILERS**!

If you find a trope mentioned interesting, you can also click on the trope link.  This will load it as the next article being reviewed, as well as add the text snippet to the list of articles you've liked.

None of this information is currently saved, since I'm only playing with the trope exploration.


## Next steps

I'm liking the text trope exploration, and will be blending it with the graph display (which by itself doesn't contain that much information).  Next steps are:

* Show a graph of the pieces the user has liked, the articles referenced on them, and which articles those have in common.
* We're currently showing as possible snippets all *twikilink* elements, but some summary articles use that only to link to other sub-sections and don't contain any actual information.  See about filtering them out.
* Handle redirects. While exploring we can encounter a link to *Anime/SailorMoon*, which is an article that is only a redirect to *Manga/SailorMoon*. The back end API that returns the references doesn't currently handle redirects.
