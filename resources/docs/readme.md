## Heads up

This is very much a work in progress - considered it pre-alpha until further
notice, more of a live sketch or thinking-out-loud than a system. 

If you have just installed it and cannot get any data, make sure you have 
[configured PostgreSQL](https://github.com/ricardojmendez/tropology/blob/develop/README.md).
 
More instructions incoming.
